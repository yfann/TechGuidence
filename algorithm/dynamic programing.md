# dynamic programing

## process
+ Identify Subproblems: Divide the main problem into smaller, independent subproblems.
+ Store Solutions: Solve each subproblem and store the solution in a table or array.
+ Build Up Solutions: Use the stored solutions to build up the solution to the main problem.
+ Avoid Redundancy: By storing solutions, DP ensures that each subproblem is solved only once, reducing computation time.
