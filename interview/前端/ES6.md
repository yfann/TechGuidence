## Interview Question:

+ What are some new features introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), and how do they improve JavaScript development?

+ Answer:

    + let and const Declarations: ES6 introduced block-scoped variables using let and constants using const. These declarations are more predictable and solve some of the issues with the traditional var declarations.

    + Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions, and they automatically bind this lexically, avoiding issues with traditional function expressions.

    + Template Literals: Template literals allow embedding expressions inside string literals using backticks (`). This feature enables multi-line strings and makes string interpolation more readable.

    + Enhanced Object Literals: ES6 introduced shorthand syntax and computed property names in object literals, making it easier to create and initialize objects.

    + Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment allows unpacking values from arrays or objects into individual variables, which simplifies working with complex data structures.

    + Default Parameters: ES6 introduced the ability to set default values for function parameters, reducing the need for manual parameter checks.

    + Rest and Spread Operators: The rest ... operator allows gathering multiple function arguments into an array, while the spread ... operator can spread array elements or object properties into function arguments or object literals.

    + Classes: ES6 introduced a more familiar class syntax, making it easier for developers coming from other programming languages to work with JavaScript objects and prototypes.

    + Modules: ES6 introduced native support for modules using the import and export keywords, improving code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

    + Promises: Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations, avoiding callback hell.

    + Generators: Generators introduce a new way to write iterable functions using the function* syntax, enabling a more natural way to pause and resume function execution.
