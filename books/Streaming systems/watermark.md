# watermark
+ The watermark is a monitonically increasing timestamp of the oldest work not yet completed.
    + completeness
    + visibility

+ event-time window close
    + the window does not expect any more data

## perfect watermark
+ Pipelines using perfect watermark creation never have to deal with late data
+ use cases
    + ingress timestamping
        +  the source watermark simply tracks the current processing time as observed by the pipeline
        + event time is processing time
    + static sets of time-ordered logs
        + e.g., an Apache Kafka topic with a static set of partitions, where each partition of the source contains monotonically increasing event times

## heuristic watermark(accurate heuristic watermarks)
+ an estimate that no data with event times less than the watermark will ever be seen again
+ Pipelines using heuristic watermark creation might need to deal with some amount of late data
+ use cases
    + Dynamic sets of time-ordered logs
        + each individual file containing records with monotonically increasing event times relative to other records in the same file but with no fixed relationship of event times between files
    + Google Cloud Pub/Sub
        + even if a single publisher publishes two messages in order, thereâ€™s a chance (usually small) that they might be delivered out of order 

## Watermark Propagation
+ Understanding how watermarks propagate across independent stages is important in understanding how they affect the pipeline as a whole and the observed latency of its results.

+ PIPELINE STAGES
    + e.g.  raw data -> per-user aggregates -> per-team aggregates
