## IPS(International Patient Summary) vs FHIR
International Patient Summary (IPS) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) are both standards for exchanging healthcare information, but they serve different purposes and have different scopes.

IPS is a standardized summary of a patient's health information that is intended to be shared across borders and healthcare systems. It contains essential clinical information, such as allergies, medications, vital signs, and diagnoses, that can help healthcare providers quickly understand a patient's health status and provide appropriate care. IPS is not a standalone standard, but rather a profile that is built on top of existing standards, such as HL7 v2 and FHIR.

FHIR, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive standard for exchanging healthcare information. It defines a set of resources and data elements that can be used to represent a wide range of clinical and administrative information, including patient demographics, clinical observations, medications, orders, and care plans. FHIR is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to implement, making it a popular choice for healthcare interoperability initiatives.

In summary, IPS is a standardized summary of a patient's health information that is intended to be shared across borders and healthcare systems, while FHIR is a more comprehensive standard for exchanging healthcare information that can represent a wide range of clinical and administrative information.
