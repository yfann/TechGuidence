## Univariate plot(involves only one variable)
+ A Univariate plot could be for a continuous variable to understand the spread and distribution of the variable while for a discrete variable it could tell us the count

+ histogram

## Bivariate plot(more than one variable in required)
+ Similarly, a Bivariate plot for continuous variable could display essential statistic like correlation, for a continuous versus discrete variable could lead us to very important conclusions like understanding data distribution across different levels of a categorical variable. A bivariate plot between two discrete variables could also be developed.

+ scatter
